"""State-specific host-only OIDC flow-cookie authority.

New browser flows use one authoritative cookie name per server-side state
transaction. An older callback can therefore clear only its own binding and
cannot overwrite or expire a newer tab's binding. During the bounded rollout,
a capped historical shared-cookie mirror is also emitted for compatibility with
pre-existing clients and tests; callbacks for new flows never delete that
mirror, and exact per-flow cookies always take precedence.
